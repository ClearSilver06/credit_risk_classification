CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS REPORT

The csv file contains information relating to loan sizes, interest rates, income, number of accounts, and total debt.

In this code file, a Logistic Regression Model is used to predict whether or not a potential loan will be either healthy (0) or high-risk (1). 

The results of the model are as follows:
    Healthy Loan Accuracy: 100%
    High-Risk Loan Accuracy: 89%
    Overall Accuracy: 99%
    Recall Score: 99%


In conclusion:
The accuracy overall for this model averages a 99%, with the healthy loan predictions being 100%. This makes it a great fit to use at least for predicting healthy loans. The accuracy for high-risk loans is a bit lower at 89% which is good but gives room for error. I would recommend testing some other models or narrowing down the more important data values to see if there is a better way of predicting high-risk loans.
